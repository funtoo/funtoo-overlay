# KIT DESIGN AND DEVELOPER DOCS

# The maintainable model for kits is to have several source repositories that contain most of our source ebuilds/
# catpkgs, which are identified by SHA1 to point to a specific snapshot. Then, we combine that with a Funtoo 'kit-fixups'
# repository that contains only our forked ebuilds. Then this script, merge-all-kits.py, is used to automatically
# generate the kits. We don't commit directly to kits themselves -- this script automatically generates commits with
# updated ebuilds. 

# A kit is generated from:

# 1. a collection of repositories and SHA1 commit to specify a snapshot of each repository to serve as a source for catpkgs,
#    eclasses, licenses. It is also possible to specify a branch name instead of SHA1 (typically 'master') although this
#    shouldn't ever be done for 'prime' branches of kits.

# 1. a selection of catpkgs (ebuilds) that are selected from source repositories. Each kit has a package-set file located 
#    in ../package-sets/*-kit relative to this file which contains patterns of catpkgs to select from each source 
#    repository and copy into the kit when regenerating it.

# 3. a collection of fix-ups (from the kit-fixups repository) that can be used to replace catpkgs in various kits globally,
#    or in a specific branch of a kit. There is also an option to provide eclasses that get copied globally to each kit,
#    to a particular kit, or to a branch of a particular kit. This is the where we fork ebuilds to fix specific issues.

# Below, the kits and branches should be defined in a way that includes all this information. It is also possible to
# have a kit that simply is a collection of ebuilds but tracks the latest gentoo-staging. It may or may not have
# additional fix-ups.

# When setting up a kit repository, the 'master' branch may used to store an 'unfrozen' kit that just tracks upstream
# Gentoo. Kits are not required to have a master branch -- we only create one if the kit is designed to offer unfrozen
# ebuilds to Funtoo users.	Examples below are: science-kit, games-kit, text-kit, net-kit. These track gentoo.

# If we have a frozen enterprise branch that we are backporting security fixes to only, we want this to be an
# 'x.y-prime' branch. This branch's overlays' source SHA1s are not supposed to change and we will just augment it with
# fix-ups as needed.

# As kits are maintained, the following things may change:
#
# 1. The package-set files may change. This can result in different packages being selected for the kit the next time it
#	 is regenerated by this script. We can add mising packages, decide to move packages to other kits, etc. This script
#	 takes care of ensuring that all necessary eclasses and licenses are included when the kit is regenerated.
#
# 2. The fix-ups may change. This allows us to choose to 'fork' various ebuilds that we may need to fix, while keeping
#	 our changes separate from the source packages. We can also choose to unfork packages.
#
# 3. Kits can be added or removed.
#
# 4. Kit branches can be created, or alternatively deprecated. We need a system for gracefully deprecating a kit that does
#	 not involve deleting the branch. A user may decide to continue using the branch even if it has been deprecated.
#
# 5. Kits can be tagged by Funtoo as being mandatory or optional. Typically, most kits will be mandatory but some effort
#	 will be made as we progress to make things like the games-kit or the science-kit optional.
#
# HOW KITS ARE GENERATED

# Currently, kits are regenerated in a particluar order, such as: "first, core-kit, then security-kit, then perl-kit",
# etc. This script keeps a running list of catpkgs that are inserted into each kit. Once a catpkg is inserted into a
# kit, it is not available to be inserted into successive kits. This design is intended to prevent multiple copies of
# catpkgs existing in multiple kits in parallel that are designed to work together as a set. At the end of kit
# generation, this master list of inserted catpkgs is used to prune the 'nokit' repository of catpkgs, so that 'nokit'
# contains the set of all ebuilds that were not inserted into kits.

# Below, you will see how the sources for kits are defined.

# 1. OVERLAYS - lists sources for catpkgs, along with properties which can include "select" - a list of catpkgs to
# include.  When "select" is specified, only these catpkgs will be available for selection by the package-set rules. .
# If no "select" is specified, then by default all available catpkgs could be included, if they match patterns, etc. in
# package-sets. Note that we do not specify branch or SHA1 here. This may vary based on kit, so it's specified elsewhere
# (see KIT SOURCES, below.)

# SUPPLEMENTAL REPOSITORIES: These are overlays that we are using but are not in KIT SOURCES. funtoo_overlay is something
# we are using only for profiles and other misc. things and may get phased out in the future:

funtoo_overlay = GitTree("funtoo-overlay", "master", "repos@git.funtoo.org:funtoo-overlay.git")

# 2. KIT SOURCES - kit sources are a combination of overlays, arranged in a python list [ ]. A KIT SOURCE serves as a
# unified collection of source catpkgs for a particular kit. Each kit can have one KIT SOURCE. KIT SOURCEs MAY be
# shared among kits to avoid duplication and to help organization. Note that this is where we specify branch or SHA1
# for each overlay.

# Each kit source can be used as a source of catpkgs for a kit. Order is important -- package-set rules are applied in
# the same order that the overlay appears in the kit_source_defs list -- so for "gentoo_current", package-set rules will
# be applied to gentoo-staging first, then flora, then faustoo, then fusion809. Once a particular catpkg matches and is
# copied into a dest-kit, a matching capkg in a later overlay, if one exists, will be ignored.

# It is important to note that we support two kinds of kit sources -- the first is the gentoo-staging master repository
# which contains a master set of eclasses and contains everything it needs for all the catpkgs it contains. The second
# kind of repository we support is an overlay that is designed to be used with the gentoo-staging overlay, so it may
# need some catpkgs (as dependencies) or eclasses from gentoo-staging. The gentoo-staging repository should always
# appear as the first item in kit_source_defs, with the overlays appearing after.

# 2. KIT GROUPS - this is where kits are actually defined. They are organized by GROUP: 'prime', 'current', or 'shared'.
# 'prime' kits are production-quality kits. Current kits are bleeding-edge kits. 'shared' kits are used by both 'prime'
# and 'current' -- they can have some "prime" kits as well as some "current" kits depending on what we want to stabilize.
# Note that we specify a 'source' which points to a name of a kit_source to use as a source of ebuilds. A kit is defined
# by a GROUP such as 'prime', a NAME, such as 'core-kit', a BRANCH, such as '1.0-prime', and a source (kit source) such
# as 'gentoo_prime'.

# It has already been explained how when we apply package-set rules, we process the kit_source repositories in order and
# after we find a catpkg that matches, any matches in successive repositories for catpkgs that we have already copied
# over to the destination kit are *ignored*. This is implemented using a dictionary called "kitted_catpkgs".  Once a
# catpkg is inserted into a kit, it's no longer 'available' to be inserted into successive kits, to avoid duplicates.

kit_order = [ 'prime', 'shared', None, 'current' ]

# We want to reset 'kitted_catpkgs' at certain points. The 'kit_order' variable below is used to control this, and we
# normally don't need to touch it. 'kitted_order' above tells the code to generate 'prime', then 'shared' (without
# resetting kitted_catpkgs to empty), then the None tells the code to reset kitted_catpkgs, so when 'current' kits are
# generated, they can include from all possible catpkgs. This is done because prime+shared is designed to be our
# primary enterprise-set of Funtoo kits. current+shared is also supported as a more bleeding edge option.

# 3. KIT PREP STEPS. To rebuild kits from scratch, we need to perform some initial actions to initialize an empty git
# repository, as well as some final actions. In the kit_steps dictionary below, indexed by kit, 'pre' dict lists the
# initial actions, and 'post' lists the final actions for the kit. There is also a special top-level key called
# 'regular-kits'. These actions are appended to any kit that is not core-kit or nokit. In addition to 'pre' and 'post'
# steps, there is also a 'copy' step that is not currently used (but is supported by getKitPrepSteps()).
